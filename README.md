- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m é…’äº• å½° / Sho Sakai.
- ðŸ‘€ I am Sho Sakai, a second-year master's student in the Mathematics Degree Program in Pure and Applied Sciences Graduate School of Science and Technology at the University of Tsukuba. My research focuses on high-dimensional statistical analysis. Beyond theoretical research, I am interested in practical applications in data science, from problem formulation to decision-making.
- ðŸ‘€ Additionally, I share my findings and code on GitHub, and write about education and personal experiences on note. I host a podcast and advocate for bone marrow donation.
