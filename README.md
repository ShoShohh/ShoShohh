- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m é…’äº• å½° / Sho Sakai.
- ðŸ‘€ I am a second-year Master's student in the Mathematics Degree Program in Pure and Applied Sciences Graduate School of Science and Technology at the University of Tsukuba, and I plan to pursue a doctoral degree.
- ðŸ‘€ My research focuses on **high-dimensional statistical analysis**. While my current research is theoretical, I am also interested in the broader context of data science, from its motivations to its applications and decision-making.
- ðŸ‘€ I publish articles and programming code related to mathematical statistics on **[GitHub](https://github.com/ShoShohh)**, and I share teaching-related and personal articles on **[note](https://note.com/sho_77)** Additionally, I am involved in volunteer activities as a member of several organizations.
